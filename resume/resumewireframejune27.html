<p>I am the lead writer and editor for Chesapeake Quarterly,
an award-winning science magazine that focuses on the research
influencing policies in the nation’s largest estuary.
I also edit student blogs and have supervised interns
with an interest in writing, journalism and filmmaking
from Howard University and Morgan State University.  I also produce reports, fact sheets, books and other internal communications products.
I serve on various committees and panels,
including a university-wide diversity initiative,
and I am working to develop an environmental journalism course at Morgan State.</p>
